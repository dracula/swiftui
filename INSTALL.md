#### Install using Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

Dracula support SwiftPM from version 5.3. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [Dracula repo's URL](https://github.com/rphlfc/Dracula.git). 

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/rphlfc/Dracula/master.zip) option and unzip them.

Copy `Dracula.swift` and `Colors.xcassets` to your project's folder.
